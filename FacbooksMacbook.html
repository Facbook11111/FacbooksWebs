<p>Review is still in progress<p>

<p>So I just recently bought a Macbook Air, Lets just say my old laptop kinda got killed by my Macbook Air. So here are my cons and pros of the Macbook Air</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>4gbs of ram</p>

<p>120gbs of storage</p>

<p>The lack of ports</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>The Screen is bright</p>

<p>The microphone and video quality is fine</p>

<p>Can watch 4k Videos</p>

<p>Great for older games (unless you upgrade the ram like I will)</p>

<p>$300 is a steal price.</p>

<p>9/10 Would Recommend</p>
